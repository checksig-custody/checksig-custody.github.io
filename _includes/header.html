            <h2><em>Open Transparent Multi-Party Bitcoin Custody Solution</em></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Bitcoin is about <em>financial sovereignty</em>
                and having direct control of
                your keys because, as people say,
                <em>not your keys, not your bitcoins</em>.
                Nonetheless, there are cases like financial institutions,
                high-net-worth individuals, lack of proper technical skills,
                etc. where a custodial solution
                might be convenient or even prescribed.
            </p>
            <p>
                CheckSig implements an open transparent
                multi-party custody protocol that:
                <ul>
                    <li>avoids reliance on "security by obscurity", being
                        an auditable <em>public standard</em>
                        subject to peer review;</li>
                    <li>provides transparency to the custodian's clients,
                        so that they can be certain that their assets are
                        held in a secure manner.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The guiding principles defining this protocol are:
                <ul>
                    <li>to store bitcoin under custody in such a way as to minimize
                        risk of loss of funds through theft, error, or other mishap;</li>
                    <li>to rely on the Bitcoin Core protocol implementation
                            for security wherever possible, rather than
                            inventing new functionality or procedures;</li>
                     <li>to remain neutral regarding future changes to the
                         Bitcoin protocol.</li>
                </ul>
